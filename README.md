# Gill Or Be Gilled
A proof-of-concept Fish-based PVP plugin.

### How to use:
Download the world.zip file, and paste the world into a server.

### Game Rules:
The top chest contains fish, and it regenerates every 10 seconds.  Each of the six fish have unique abilities.  They can only be used in water.

The bottom chest contains utility items such as a Knockback X sword that can be used to hamper your opponents.

This game is meant to be played in adventure mode.  It can also be played as a minigame on a server network.  Feel free to fork this repository and improve this idea.
